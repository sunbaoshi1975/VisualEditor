# VisualEditor & PowerVoice

This is a GUI tool for creating and updating IVR call flow that comes with PowerCall callcenter solution. Along with PowerVoice, which is the IVR service, you can setup an IVR demo system on Dialogic (both analog and digital cards) or Cisco CUCM (VoIP) platform.

Although it's a very old program I was working on, a couple of users are still running it for their customer services. Considering there is no longer official technical support, I open the source code for those who may be interested. 

It is all on yourself to use the code for any purpose. Please contact me if you think it is NOT appropriate my opening the source code to the public.
